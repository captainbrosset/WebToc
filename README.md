# tocex - A table of contents extractor in your browser

This browser extension generates a table of contents from the `h1` to `h6` tags in the current page, and displays it in the sidebar. It is useful for reviewing the content of long articles and documentation and quickly jumping around.

Only tested with Edge for the moment.
